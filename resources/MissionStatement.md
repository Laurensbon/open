#### Appsterdam Vision / Mission 
(in 3-5 sentences)

Appsterdam is a global non-profit organization that empowers established and aspiring app makers through knowledge sharing, community building, and advocacy.

We cater to the needs of the app making community through our events and linking people to each other.

#### Track record 
(100 WWLLs, 20 Gurus Sessions, x podcasts, X Pitch clubs, "Open For Business" initiative, etc)

#### Current Organization / team?
* Judy Chen - Chief Operating Officer, Board Member
* Tara Ross - Chief Community Officer, Board Member
* Martinus Meiborg - Board Member
* Klaas Speller - Board Member
* Mike Lee - Board Member and "Mayor of Appsterdam." Mike acts as a spokesperson and evangelist for Appsterdam, promoting our cause and helping people become better app makers.
* Olga Paraskevopoulou

#### What we could accomplish in the next 2 years if we had funding (or other non-monetary resources). 
How would we organize ourselves to accomplish it? Some ideas would be: hire a central team so it's not just volunteers; pay Gurus for Guru sessions; provide innovation coaching; provide legal / residency support, etc.
